Return a random element with a false positive rate
    k / N,
where k is size of black list set and N is cardinality of domain.

Randomly sample without replacement m of the k elements
and returning the first sample with no collisions.

The false positive rate is r = (k - m)/N, and the no-collision
outcome is geometrically distributed with probability of no
collision 1-r and thus there are expected to be 1/(1-r) trials.
