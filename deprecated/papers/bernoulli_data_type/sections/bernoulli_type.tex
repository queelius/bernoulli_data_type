\section{Random approximate algebraic data types}
%An algebraic data type is defined by a set of \emph{higher-order} operations on \emph{data types}.
%In other words, operations on sets, like Cartesian product or disjoint union.
Viewing a \emph{type} as a set, most programming languages have primitive types like \emph{integers}, \emph{Booleans}, and \emph{characters}.
In C++, these are respectively denoted by \mintinline{c++}{int}, \mintinline{c++}{bool}, and \mintinline{c++}{char} with cardinalities given respectively by $2^{32}$, $2^8$, and $2^1$.
Any type needs one or more \emph{value constructors} to construct objects that model values in that type.
For instance, in C++ the value that denotes the Boolean value of \emph{true} is constructed with the syntax \mintinline{c++}{true}.

The \emph{unit} type is special singleton set with a single value, i.e., a cardinality of $2^0$.
In C++, the confusing notation of \mintinline{c++}{void} denotes the unit type (and the single value).
\begin{remark}
The \emph{absurd} type is a special type with zero values, i.e., the \emph{empty set}.
Since there are no values in the absurd type, no values of this type can be constructed.
There is no primitive absurd type in C++.
\end{remark}

A \emph{product type} is the $n$-fold Cartesian product of zero or more types where the zero-th product is the unit type.
For instance, in C++, \mintinline{c++}{struct { char y, bool z }} is a \emph{named} product type and \mintinline{c++}{tuple<char,bool>}
is the \emph{unamed} counterpart, where both are product types \mintinline{c++}{char} $\times$ \mintinline{c++}{bool}.
The cardinality of this product type is $2^8 \cdot 2^1 = 512$.
One way a particular value of this product type may be constructed is \mintinline{c++}{tuple<char,bool>('a', true)}.

The values of a sum type are typically grouped into several classes, called variants.
The set of all possible values of a sum type is the disjoint union of the sets of all possible values of its variants.
For instance, in C++, \mintinline{c++}{variant<char,bool>}
is the sum type \mintinline{c++}{char} $+$ \mintinline{c++}{bool}, which has a cardinality of $2^8 + 2^1 = 258$.
One way a particular value of this sum type may be constructed is \mintinline{c++}{variant<char,bool>('1', true)}.
A particularly useful type in C++ is \mintinline{c++}{optional<X>}, which conceptually models the sum type \mintinline{c++}{X} + \mintinline{c++}{void} where \mintinline{c++}{void} denotes the variant ``not a value of type \mintinline{c++}{X}.'
\begin{remark}
This is not valid C++ syntax, even though the unit type value should be first-class.
\end{remark}
The cardinality of the \mintinline{c++}{optional<X>} is the cardinality of \mintinline{c++}{X} plus $1$.
We label the value in this singleton \emph{nothing} and may test whether a particular value is either \emph{nothing} or alternatively a value in \mintinline{c++}{X}.

Exponential types are \emph{functions}.
In C++, \mintinline{c++}{[](tuple<char,bool>) -> bool} is the set of functions \mintinline{c++}{char} $\times$ \mintinline{c++}{bool} $\mapsto$ \mintinline{c++}{bool}, which has a cardinality of $2^{512}$.
Usually, a more convenient syntax is used, like \mintinline{c++}{[](char,bool) -> bool}.
The constant \mintinline{c++}{true} function of the exponential type \mintinline{c++}{char} $\times$ \mintinline{c++}{bool} $\mapsto$ \mintinline{c++}{bool} may be constructed with the definition \mintinline{c++}{[](char,bool) -> bool { return true; }}.
\begin{remark}
The exponential type \mintinline{c++}{[](X x) -> void} is of little practical value and, in C++, usually denotes a \emph{procedure} that causes \emph{side-effects} like writing to IO.
\end{remark}

Recall that any subset of a set corresponds to a \emph{relation}. Types are \emph{subsets} of the algebraic types where subsets are defined by \emph{invariants}.
We may compose primitive types to specify a variety of \emph{compound} types.
\begin{example}
\emph{Rationals} may be implemented as a product type of two integers,
\begin{minted}{c++}
  using Rational = tuple<int,int>,
\end{minted}
where the first and last elements of the tuple represent the numerator and denominator respectively.
If the invariant is that the denominator is not $0$, then a \emph{value constructor} \mintinline{c++}{rational} $\colon$ \mintinline{c++}{int} $\times$ \mintinline{c++}{int} $\mapsto$ \mintinline{c++}{optional<Rational>} that takes a numerator and denominator and outputs either a rational or, if the invariants are violated, \emph{nothing}, is given by \cref{lst:valuector}.\footnote{Alternatively, the value constructor can be a \emph{partial function} \mintinline{c++}{rational} $\colon$ \mintinline{c++}{int} $\times$ \mintinline{c++}{int} $\pfun$ \mintinline{c++}{Rational} that is undefined for input $\Pair{x}{0}$ for any $x \in$ \mintinline{c++}{int}.}

optional<Rational> rational(int num, int denom)
{
  if (denom == 0)
    return {}; // Return the value that denotes $\text{\emph{nothing}}$.  
  return tuple<int,int>(num, denom);
}.
\end{minted}
\caption{A value constructor for rationals.}
\label{lst:valuector}
\end{listing}

The expected operators on rationals, like addition \mintinline{c++}{operator+(Rational,Rational) -> Rational}, may be implemented so that \mintinline{c++}{Rational} models the \emph{concept} of rationals.
%As long as we use \emph{regular} functions over a regular syntax, we may substitute any rational implementation for any other to produce equivalent behavior on any algorithm.

The \mintinline{c++}{Rational} type is a subset of the product type \mintinline{c++}{tuple<int,int>} and is thus
a \emph{binary relation} on $\IntSet \times \IntSet$.
\begin{remark}
We implemented \mintinline{c++}{Rational} as a product type \mintinline{c++}{tuple<int,int>} and a value constructor \mintinline{c++}{rational} for pedagogical reasons, but generally programming structures like \emph{class} are utilized since they facilitate important concepts like \emph{encapsulation}.
\end{remark}
\end{example}

Each of these types and operators has a corresponding random approximation, e.g., the exponential type is just a random approximate map, and the \emph{relations} that define types are just random approximate relations with \emph{deterministic} properties that model the invariants.

The invariants may not be easy to satisfy, and so a random approximation relation of the corresponding type may not be practical.
However, when the invariants can be satisfied, we may implement \emph{random approximate algebraic data types} of the \emph{algebraic data types}, e.g., we can compose random approximate algebraic data types as before to construct compound random approximate data types of the corresponding compound algebraic data type.

This may not seem particularly useful, but it permits space-efficient representations and, moreover, concepts like \emph{oblivious algebraic data types} may be based on it with some notion of closure.
