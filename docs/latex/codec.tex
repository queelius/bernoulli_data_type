A {\itshape datum} is a sequence of bits. A {\itshape value} is a sequence of bits and its interpretation. A {\itshape value type} is a set of values sharing a common interpretation.

We denote the datum assigned to a value {\ttfamily x} by `x'{\ttfamily . We say that}x{\ttfamily is $\ast$coded$\ast$ by}x\textquotesingle{}{\ttfamily . Inversely, we say that}x\textquotesingle{}{\ttfamily has an $\ast$decoding$\ast$ (interpretation)}x\`{}. A datum without an {\itshape interpretation} has no meaning.

For example, {\itshape characters} are a fundamental {\itshape value type}. Suppose we have a set of three characters, {\ttfamily \{a,b,c\}} with codes given by the following table.

\tabulinesep=1mm
\begin{longtabu}spread 0pt [c]{*{2}{|X[-1]}|}
\hline
\PBS\centering \cellcolor{\tableheadbgcolor}\textbf{ character   }&\PBS\centering \cellcolor{\tableheadbgcolor}\textbf{ code    }\\\cline{1-2}
\endfirsthead
\hline
\endfoot
\hline
\PBS\centering \cellcolor{\tableheadbgcolor}\textbf{ character   }&\PBS\centering \cellcolor{\tableheadbgcolor}\textbf{ code    }\\\cline{1-2}
\endhead
{\ttfamily a}   &{\ttfamily 0}    \\\cline{1-2}
{\ttfamily b}   &{\ttfamily 10}    \\\cline{1-2}
{\ttfamily c}   &{\ttfamily 110}   \\\cline{1-2}
\end{longtabu}


In the above table, {\ttfamily c} and {\ttfamily 110} are associated, i.\+e., {\ttfamily c} is coded as `c' = 110{\ttfamily and}c\textquotesingle{}{\ttfamily is decoded as}c\`{}.

\begin{quote}
{\bfseries{remark}}\+: The codes in the above table are {\itshape prefix-\/free} codes. A sequence characters with prefix free codes may be unambiguously coded by simply {\itshape concatenating} the invidiaul codes, e.\+g., `(a b c)' $<$-\/$>$ 010110\`{}. \end{quote}
The interpretation of a value type is dictated by a set of operations. In the case of {\itshape characters}, we snuck in a lot of common understandings, e.\+g., the common understanding that the set of characters typically has an agreed upon {\itshape order}, i.\+e., alphabetic order.

To be explicit, we must also define these operations. For instance, using C++ notation, ordered sets have a less-\/than binary operator denoted by {\ttfamily $<$(char,char) -\/$>$ \{0,1\}}. Given the way the characters are coded in the above table, the less-\/than operator has a definition equivalent to `$<$(x,y) \+:= $<$($\vert$x'$\vert$, $\vert$y\textquotesingle{}$\vert$){\ttfamily , where}$\vert$x\textquotesingle{}$\vert${\ttfamily and}$\vert$y\textquotesingle{}$\vert$\`{} are integer types with the common understanding of the less-\/than operator on integer types.

Binary operators apply to the Cartesian of the set of values. We may thus represent {\ttfamily $<$(char, char) -\/$>$ \{0,1\}} with the equivalent definition given by the following table.

\tabulinesep=1mm
\begin{longtabu}spread 0pt [c]{*{2}{|X[-1]}|}
\hline
\PBS\centering \cellcolor{\tableheadbgcolor}\textbf{ {\ttfamily (char, char)}   }&\PBS\centering \cellcolor{\tableheadbgcolor}\textbf{ {\ttfamily $<$(char,char)}    }\\\cline{1-2}
\endfirsthead
\hline
\endfoot
\hline
\PBS\centering \cellcolor{\tableheadbgcolor}\textbf{ {\ttfamily (char, char)}   }&\PBS\centering \cellcolor{\tableheadbgcolor}\textbf{ {\ttfamily $<$(char,char)}    }\\\cline{1-2}
\endhead
{\ttfamily (a,a)}   &{\ttfamily 0}    \\\cline{1-2}
{\ttfamily (a,b)}   &{\ttfamily 1}    \\\cline{1-2}
{\ttfamily (a,c)}   &{\ttfamily 1}    \\\cline{1-2}
{\ttfamily (b,a)}   &{\ttfamily 0}    \\\cline{1-2}
{\ttfamily (b,b)}   &{\ttfamily 0}    \\\cline{1-2}
{\ttfamily (b,c)}   &{\ttfamily 1}    \\\cline{1-2}
{\ttfamily (c,a)}   &{\ttfamily 0}    \\\cline{1-2}
{\ttfamily (c,b)}   &{\ttfamily 0}    \\\cline{1-2}
{\ttfamily (c,c)}   &{\ttfamily 0}   \\\cline{1-2}

The datums of a value type cannot exist without a computer (physical system) storing them in memory. The way a value type is implemented on a computer is denoted an {\itshape object type}.

A concept is a named set of requirements. Object type {\ttfamily X} implements the {\ttfamily Codec} concept for an object type {\ttfamily Y} if the following requirements are satisfied\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily X} is a \mbox{\hyperlink{regular_type_md_REGULAR_TYPE_CONCEPT}{Regular\+Type}} .
\item {\ttfamily X} must have a public member type {\ttfamily value\+\_\+type}, the type of the coded values, i.\+e., {\ttfamily X\+::value\+\_\+type}.
\item {\ttfamily X} must have an public member type {\ttfamily size\+\_\+type} that is an {\ttfamily Integer} type and has a maximum value large enough to represent any coded value of type {\ttfamily value\+\_\+type}.
\item If objects of type {\ttfamily value\+\_\+type} has a maximum encoding size, then it may have a public member function named {\ttfamily maximum\+\_\+bit\+\_\+length} that returns the maximum bit length of a coded value of type {\ttfamily value\+\_\+type}.
\item {\ttfamily X} must have a public member function compatible with the signature
\end{DoxyEnumerate}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{template <OutputIterator O>}
\DoxyCodeLine{size\_type X::encode(value\_type, O);}

\end{DoxyCode}


that encodes a value of type {\ttfamily value\+\_\+type} to the output iterator and returns the number of bits written. Typically, the encode function returns a value of type {\ttfamily size\+\_\+type} to indicate how many bits were written to the output iterator, but it may return something else, like {\ttfamily optional$<$size\+\_\+type$>$}, which evaluates to a {\ttfamily size\+\_\+type} if successful and otherwise to {\ttfamily null}.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily X} must have the member function with signature
\end{DoxyEnumerate}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{template <InputIterator I>}
\DoxyCodeLine{optional<value\_type> decode(I);}

\end{DoxyCode}


which decodes an encoded value of type {\ttfamily value\+\_\+type} from the bits in an input iterator {\ttfamily I}.
