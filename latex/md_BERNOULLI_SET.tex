Let {\ttfamily F = array$<$bool,N$>$} be the set of all arrays of {\ttfamily N} Boolean values. Consider the Boolean algebra 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{(F, +, *, \string~, F\{\textcolor{keyword}{false}\}, F\{\textcolor{keyword}{true}\})}

\end{DoxyCode}
 where {\ttfamily false} denotes the array of {\ttfamily N} {\ttfamily false} values and {\ttfamily F\{true\}} denotes the array of {\ttfamily N} {\ttfamily true} values. The {\ttfamily +} and {\ttfamily $\ast$} operators are defined as element-\/wise {\ttfamily or} and {\ttfamily and} respectively. The {\ttfamily $\sim$} operator is defined as element-\/wise {\ttfamily not}.

Suppose the {\ttfamily contains} predicate function 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{contains : (F,int) -\/> bool}

\end{DoxyCode}
 is defined as 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{auto} contains(\textcolor{keyword}{auto} A, \textcolor{keyword}{auto} i) \{ \textcolor{keywordflow}{return} i >= 0 \&\& i < N \&\& A[i]; \}}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Likewise, suppose the equality operator 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{== : (F, F) -\/> bool}

\end{DoxyCode}
 is defined as 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{auto} operator==(\textcolor{keyword}{auto} lhs, \textcolor{keyword}{auto} rhs) \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    std::all\_of(lhs.begin(), lhs.end(), rhs.begin(), rhs.end(),}
\DoxyCodeLine{        [](\textcolor{keyword}{auto} x, \textcolor{keyword}{auto} y) \{ return x == y; \});}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}


Consider a Bernoulli Boolean value. Since there are only two possible values, {\ttfamily \{true, false\}}, we have the follow situations to consider. First, let {\ttfamily xj} indicate the {\ttfamily j}th element of the array {\ttfamily x} and let {\ttfamily Pr\{E\}} denote the probability of the event {\ttfamily E}.

0. {\ttfamily Pr\{bernoulli$<$bool$>$\{xj\} == xj\} = 1} where {\ttfamily xj} is either {\ttfamily true} or {\ttfamily false}. This is a zeroth-\/order Bernoulli model, i.\+e., {\ttfamily bernoulli$<$bool,0$>$} is equivalent to {\ttfamily bool} and an array of them is equivalent to an array of {\ttfamily bool}. This is like a {\itshape perfect channel} where no noise is introduced.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily Pr\{bernoulli$<$bool$>$\{xj\} == xj\} = p} for all {\ttfamily j} and {\ttfamily 0 $<$ p $<$ 1}. This is a first-\/order Bernoulli model. This is equialent to a {\itshape binary symmetric channel} where noise is i.\+i.\+d. and independent of the input. We denote each of these as {\ttfamily bernoulli$<$bool,1$>$} and an array of them as {\ttfamily array$<$bernoulli$<$bool,1$>$,N$>$}. Note that this is equivalent to {\ttfamily bernoulli$<$array$<$bool,N$>$$>$} and there is technically only one parameter, {\ttfamily p}, in the confusion matrix that needs to be estimated.
\item {\ttfamily Pr\{bernoulli$<$bool$>$\{xj\} == xj$\vert$xj == TRUE\} = p1} and {\ttfamily Pr\{bernoulli$<$bool$>$\{xj\} == xj$\vert$xj == FALSE\} = p2} for all {\ttfamily j} and {\ttfamily p1 != p2} and both are non-\/zero and also not equal to one. This is a second-\/order Bernoulli model where the probability of error is different for {\ttfamily true} and {\ttfamily false} but the same for all indexes. This is like a {\itshape binary asymmetric channel} where noise is introduced that is dependent on the input.
\item {\ttfamily Pr\{bernoulli$<$bool$>$\{xj\} == xj$\vert$xj == TRUE\} = p(xj$\vert$\+TRUE)} and {\ttfamily Pr\{bernoulli$<$bool$>$\{xj\} == xj$\vert$xj == FALSE\} = p(xj$\vert$\+FALSE)}. This is a higher-\/order Bernoulli model where the probability of error may be different for each index and for each value. The maximum order of this model is {\ttfamily 2$^\wedge$N(2$^\wedge$\+N-\/1)}.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Regardless, when we have these Bernoulli Booleans, this induces a Bernoulli Model of the Boolean algebra. We denote this mathematical structure the Bernoulli set model, {\ttfamily bernoulli$<$set$<$X$>$$>$}.

A natural way to construct a Bernoulli set is to allow false positives on non-\/members but no false negatives, such as in the Bloom filter. However, there is also an opportunity to allow for false negatives by introducing a rate distrotion either due to time complexity constraints or space constraints. We consider a Bernoulli set model, named {\ttfamily rd\+\_\+ph\+\_\+filter} and {\ttfamily rd\+\_\+hash\+\_\+set}, that allows for false positive and false negatives, and also an entropy coder in which the probability of a membership test is implicitly represented by prefix-\/free codes such that the probability of an error varies for each element being tested. The end result is a very compact data structure that, for the given compression rate, has the lowest probability of error. (Expected loss is minimized.)

Even a Bernoulli set that, say, only allows for false positives, can {\itshape generate} a Bernoulli set that allows for false negatives. For example, consider the Bloom filter. The Bloom filter is a Bernoulli set that allows for false positives but no false negatives. However, if we take the complement of the Bloom filter, we get a Bernoulli set that allows for false negatives but no false positives. In general, set-\/theoretic operations on Bernoulli sets can generate Bernoulli sets of a different or higher order.
